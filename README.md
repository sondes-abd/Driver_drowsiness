#Driver Drowsiness Detection System ðŸš—ðŸ’¤

This project is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system designed to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by fatigue. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MRL Eye Dataset to monitor the driver's eye state (open or closed) via a live camera feed. A user-friendly interface built with PyQt captures video input and detects drowsiness in real-time.

When drowsiness is detected, the system:

_ **Triggers an alarm** to alert the driver.

_ **Sends a notification**to a designated contact (e.g., family or fleet manager) using the Pushover app.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design to address a critical safety issue.
